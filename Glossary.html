            Displays paths that have differences between the index file and the current
            HEAD commit, paths that have differences between the working tree and the
            index file, and paths in the working tree that are not tracked by Git
            (and are not ignored by gitignore).

            A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within
            the repository, but does not affect the primary or master branch allowing
            you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. When you've
            made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into
            the master branch to publish your changes.
