            Displays paths that have differences between the index file and the current
            HEAD commit, paths that have differences between the working tree and the
            index file, and paths in the working tree that are not tracked by Git
            (and are not ignored by gitignore).

            A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within
            the repository, but does not affect the primary or master branch allowing
            you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. When you've
            made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into
            the master branch to publish your changes.
        </dd>
        <dt>reset</dt>
        <dd>
            The reset command is one of the very few git commands that will destroy data if
            it is used with the --hard flag. git reset --hard [commit point] will take
            everything back to a specified commit point. Any un-committed changes will be lost.
            The default git reset [commit point] undoes the last git commit and git add commands
            but leaves the working tree as it is. The command git reset --soft [commit point]
            just resets the last commit command but leaves the previous staged changes.
