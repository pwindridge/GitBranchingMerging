            Displays paths that have differences between the index file and the current
            HEAD commit, paths that have differences between the working tree and the
            index file, and paths in the working tree that are not tracked by Git
            (and are not ignored by gitignore).

            A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within
            the repository, but does not affect the primary or master branch allowing
            you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. When you've
            made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into
            the master branch to publish your changes.

        <dd>
            When you want to get and set different configuration variables for the
            particular repository that you're working on or, globally, for all
            repositories, you use config. These configuration variables control all
            aspects of how Git looks and operates.

        <dt>reset</dt>
        <dd>
            Running git reset [filename] will remove any changes in a file that is currently
            staged for commit. If changes were made to Glossary.html, and the command git add
            Glossary.html was run, then issuing git reset Glossary.html would effectively
            those changes because it would change the staged file state to what it was in the
            last commit. Calling git reset [commit point] Glossary.html would change the state
            of the staged file to the state it had at the given specified commit point.
        </dd>
        <dt>log</dt>
        <dd>
            The command git log allows you to view your commit history. Various options exist
            to view your history with different levels of detail and in different ways. A useful
            command is git log --all --oneline --decorate --graph which allows you to view
            the commit history visually.
